# College National Event Registration Website

This project is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate registration for college events, specifically Eureka and Jidnyasa. The website provides a seamless interface for participants to register for various events, offering a user-friendly experience with modern web technologies.

## Project Description

This website is designed to manage and streamline the registration process for college events like Eureka and Jidnyasa. It allows participants to register, providing necessary details and uploading relevant documents. The system categorizes registrations based on the selected event and department, making it easier to manage and review the entries.

### Eureka

Eureka is a Paper Presentation Competition where participants present their papers on given subjects. Winners are determined based on the quality of their paper and presentation skills.

### Jidnyasa

Jidnyasa is another significant event, focusing on different themes and activities, promoting creativity, technology, and learning. Participants showcase their skills and knowledge in various domains.

### Event Date

The event is organized on April 20, 2024. Due to this website, the college has seen an increase in registration and participation. Colleges from distant locations can now easily access all the information and register through this platform. As a result, there was a notable increase in the participation of students from other colleges in 2024 compared to previous years. This website has proven to be very helpful for our TKIET Warnanagar College.
